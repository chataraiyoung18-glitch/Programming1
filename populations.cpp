//Description: This program will calculate how many years it takes for Town A's population to become greater than or equal to Town B's.

#iclude <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  //Declare variables for populations and growth rates
  double Town A, Town B;
  double growth A, growth B;
  int years = 0;

// Get the starting populations
cout << "Enter the initial population of town A: ";
cin >> growth A;

cout << "Enter the initial population or town B: ";
cin >> growth A;

//Get the annual growth rates
cout << "Enter the growth rate of town A (%): ";
cin >> growth A;

cout << "Enter the growth rate of town B (%): ";
cin >> growth B;

//Convert percentages into decimal values
growth A = growth A / 100;
growth B = growth B / 100;

//Repeat method until town A catches up with town B 
while ( town A < town B)
{
  //Increase both town populations each year
  townA = townA + (townA * growthA);
  townB = townB + (townB * growthB);

// Keep track of the number of years
years++;
}

//Display the results
cout << fixed << setprecsion(2)

cout "Number of years: " << years << endl;

cout "Population of town A: " << townA << endl;

cout "Population of town B: " << townB << endl;
